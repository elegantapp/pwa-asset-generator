## Motivation â€” [read full blog post here](https://itnext.io/pwa-splash-screen-and-icon-generator-a74ebb8a130)

When you build a PWA with a goal of providing native-like experiences on multiple platforms and stores, you need to meet with the criteria of those platforms and stores with your PWA assets; icon sizes and splash screens. Such criteria are;

* Google's Android platform respects Web App Manifest API specs and it expects you to provide at least 2 icon sizes in your manifest file - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/#icons ðŸ¤”

* As it's noted on Microsoft docs, your PWA has to meet specific image criteria declared on Web App Manifest in order to be automatically packaged for Microsoft Store - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps/get-started#web-app-manifest ðŸ¤”

* Apple's iOS currently doesn't support Web App Manifest API specs. You need to introduce custom html tags to set icons and splash screens to your PWA ðŸ¤”
    * You need to introduce a special html link tag with rel `apple-touch-icon` to provide icons for your PWA when it's added to home screen. Read more about it on [Apple's Icon Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/) and [Safari Web Content Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html). 
    * You need to introduce a special html link tag with rel `apple-touch-startup-image` to provide splash screen for your PWA to display when it's opened and in the background. You need to create a splash screen image for every resolution on [Apple's Launch Screen Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/launch-screen/#static-launch-screen-images-not-recommended) and html tag with media attr for each image like `<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="temp/apple-splash-2048-2732.png" media="(device-width: 1024px) and (device-height: 1366px) and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (orientation: portrait)">`. Unfortunately, this requirement is not documented on [Safari Web Content Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html) sufficiently.
    
Creating icon and splash screen images for all the platforms, maintaining sizes and quality for all and adding html tags for each image can be overwhelming. So, why not automate it? ðŸ’¡

## Features

PWA Asset Generator automates the image generation in a creative way. Having [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) in its core enables lots of possibilities. 

* Generates both icons and splash screens with optional `--icon-only` `--splash-only` `--landscape-only` and `--portrait-only` flags âœ¨

* Updates your `manifest.json` and `index.html` files automatically for declaring generated image assets ðŸ™Œ

* Scrapes latest specs from Apple Human Interface guidelines website via Puppeteer to make your PWA ready for all/recent iOS devices out there ðŸ¤–

    * Supports offline mode and uses static spec data when things go wrong with scraping ðŸ“´

* Uses Chrome browser as itâ€™s a canvas of your fav image editor. It uses a shell HTML file as an artboard and centers your logo before taking screenshots for each resolution via Puppeteer ðŸ¤–

* You can provide your source in multiple formats; a local image file, a local HTML file, a remote image or HTML file ðŸ™Œ

    * When itâ€™s an image source, it is centered over the background option you provide ðŸŒ…
    * When itâ€™s an HTML source, you can go as creative as you like; position your logo, use SVG filters, use variable fonts, use gradient backgrounds, use typography and etc. Your html file is rendered on Chrome before taking screenshots for each resolution ðŸŽ¨

## Troubleshooting

In case of getting "No usable sandbox!" error on Linux, you need to enable [system sandboxing](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#setting-up-chrome-linux-sandbox).
